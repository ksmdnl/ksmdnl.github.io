  I am a master student at RWTH Aachen in electrical engineering, pursuing deep interest and curiosity in deep learning. <br><br>
  
  <h2>Initial</h2>
  My interest in the field rose when I was active as a working student in the automobile industry, specifically at IAV, for over few years.
  During that time I had the opportunity to work in a engaging team, where I learned a lot about the on-board diagnostic systems on vehicles 
  by analysing the measurement data picked up by all kinds of sensors. My task in the team was to maintain the codebase that automises the
  evaluation and the analysis depending on the requirements and to further develop the functions for visualisation.<br><br>
  Sometime during the pandemic I was assigned to help another team in setting up a pipeline to perform an abration analysis of water and oil pumps
  using measurement data, such as vibration, temperature, bear rings, etc. That was where I got to dive deep into the tool used for the project 
  that centers around Python and its dependencies such as Numpy, SciPy, and Numpy. At the end of the initial project we made use of Scikit-learn
  for building a regression model. Since then I've been fascinated with the topics and trying to facilitise my curiosity in the following projects at the campus.<b></b>

  <h2>Learning curve</h2>
    During and after my bachelor thesis I was working with <a
    href="https://andrbaer.github.io/">Andreas Bär</a> under the supervision of <a
    href="https://www.tu-braunschweig.de/ifn/institut/abt/sv/prof-dr-ing-tim-fingscheidt">Prof. Dr-Ing. Tim Fingscheidt</a>
    in the Signal Processing and Machine Learning. In my bachelor thesis I investigated the possibility of extending the pre-built
    framework to predict the performance of semantic segmentation. To be precise, I tried to extend the framework to object detection.
    The model behind the framework consists of the segmentation model of encoder-decoder structure and an additional decoder that reconstructs the input.
    In short, the model should makes use of the quality of the reconstructed image to predict using regression the quality of the produced segmentation map.
    The challenge lies upon the fact that a typical object detection produces, I assume, different kind of representation
    from a typical semantic segmentation. According to our observation a different approach from the vanilla ones is needed to accomplish this function transfer.
    Instead, I decided to make an extension in the domain semantic segmentation, where I investigated the use of other metrics to evaluate the image quality, i.e. instead of
    the classical peak-to-signal noise ratio I applied the structural similarity metrics such as SSIM and MS-SSIM which produces a better performance prediction accuracy.
    By incorporating the structural similarity loss in the optimization not only the correlation of both tasks but also the prediction error can be improved. <br><br>

    Upon completing my bachelor thesis in parallel I was helping Andreas on few projects such as exploring the ensemble models of object detection module
    and semantic segmentation.<br><br>
    Following that we were preparing for a submission on the Workshop on Autonomous Driving CVPR 2023. In our paper we improve the framework that
    predicts the performance of semantic segmentation models. Specifically, we firstly made improvements by performing architectural changes in the model, more efficient
    optimization methods. By applying a combination of these two the prediction error and the correlation are improved.<br><br>
    
    Secondly, we laid a foundation of which range the framework extendable is, since in the first paper
    only one particular backbone, which is ResNet-18, was investigated. However, due to the developments in computing capability bigger and more complex architectures are
    becoming ubiquitous. We studied the extendability on deeper models, from ResNet-50, ConvNeXt to Transformer-based architecture such as Swin Transformer. Furthermore,
    we also studied the extendability on other segmentation head such as the state-of-the-art architecture DeepLabV3+. Our paper was accepted and we hope to 
    contribute on making artificial intelligence safer.<br><br>
